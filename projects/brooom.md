# Brooom: Race your way up!

**A broom racing game in which you fly through hoops, avoid obstacles, collect power-ups, use magic to your advantage and compete with opponents to become the number one.**

*Project start:* April 2023

*Estimated date of completion:* April 2025 (implementation), July 2025 (master thesis text)

*Repository*: https://github.com/Michelle123211/Brooom

*Progress*:

- I have started with writing down a game design document (GDD) which serves as a basis for the implementation.
- Now I'm gradually implementing all the necessary parts. So far it is:
  - Gameplay mechanics - flying, broom upgrades, hoops, power-ups, achievements.
  - Procedural level generation.
  - 3D models - hoops, broom, player character (+ idle animations), environment elements.
  - Basic UI - main menu, setting, loading screen, character customization, HUD, player overview, shop, race results, cutscenes.
  - Utilities - localization, keys rebinding, persistent save system, tooltips, custom messaging system, cheats.
  - Opponents' artificial intelligence.
  - Spell system (including spell casting AI).
  - Music and sound effects.
  - Better UI.
- There are still some major parts which have not been implemented yet:
  - Level optimizations.
  - Tutorial.
- After the implementation I also intend to perform a series of experiments:
  - Playtesting sessions with different players.
  - Checking the comprehensibility of the icons.
  - Evaluation of different AI implementations, if there is some time left.
- And finally, when everything is tested, debugged and polished, I will write the master thesis itself.

*Result:* You can try the [last playable version](./Brooom.zip) (from March 2025) but keep in mind it is work in progress which is still far from being finished.
