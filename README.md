# Welcome to my website!

I will use this website to list projects I have been working on in the past as well as some interesting current work.

## Bio
My name is **Michaela Štolová** and I'm from the Czech Republic.

I've just finished a Master's degree in **game development** at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague (MFF UK).

In 2023 I also taught practicals of the *Introduction to Computer Game Development* course.

## Notes (czech only)
As a preparation for the **final state exam** (you can view the [list of requirements](./notes/state_final_exam-requirements.md)) I have compiled materials with all the necessary information for the first three areas, i.e. 1. *Computer Games Development*, 2. *Computer Graphics for Computer Games*, 3. *Artificial Intelligence for Computer Games*. You can find them [here](https://github.com/Michelle123211/mgr-statnice-poznamky).
